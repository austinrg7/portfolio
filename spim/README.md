# SPIM Assembly
+ Spim is a self-contained simulator that runs MIPS32 programs. It reads and executes assembly language programs written for this processor. 
+ Spim implements almost the entire MIPS32 assembler-extended instruction set.
+ Simulations run using the terminal, handled by the spim program, with a basic UI provided by the QtSpim program.
  + Allows the user to write, debug, and run MIPS32 programs as well as view the output on all major platforms.   
+ Additional info can be found on the [Spim website](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~larus/spim.html).
